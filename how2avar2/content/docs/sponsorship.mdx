This project has two goals:

1. Create test fonts for the Chrome implementation
2. Document the steps for type designers to use avar2 in their fonts

By spearheading avar2, Google Fonts achieves its motto of “Beautiful text, Google scale” and reflects its values of Compression, Expression, Automation, and Animation.

## Special Thanks

I greatly appreciate the time and feedback of:

- Dr. Dan Reynolds and Kerstin Wallbach for their in-depth explanations of phototypesetting and providing photos of diatype discs and diatonic plates.

- Frank E. Blokland for his demonstration of the IKARUS software and screenshots of antiquing and “intelligent” interpolation and his feedback on the type design history section.
