This project has two goals:

1. Create test fonts for the Chrome implementation
2. Document the steps for type designers to use avar2 in their fonts

By spearheading avar2, Google Fonts achieves its motto of “Beautiful text, Google scale” and reflects its values of Compression, Expression, Automation, and Animation.
